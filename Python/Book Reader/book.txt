“Making my village/city better”.

(present facilities-facilities required -your ideas to motivate people -ppp model

people’s participation programme —plan of improving at least two facilities -its possible

effects on the village life -give a new name to the campaign)
"The future of India lies in its villages"
- Mahatma Gandhi

I live ina small village in Saurashtra. In the past few years, my village has developed a
lot. There are good roads, transport facilities, primary health centre and a post office. There
are two primary schools and one high school in my village.

But I feel a lot can be still done. And this can be done with the help and cooperation of
the people of the village. I would like to implement the PPP (people’s participation
programme) model to implement my ideas.

First, I would like to see some changes in education. I would like to have a college in my
village. Today, many students do not get college education, because the nearest college is
almost 25km.away in a town. I would also like to open a night school for adults, especially the

EE EEE EEE EEE EEE EEE EE

women .women’s empowerment is a must today.

Secondly, I would like to have a good library in the village. There should be a bank too.
And every household in the village should have at least one account in the bank.

There are good irrigation facilities. But I would like the farmers to use better seeds and latest
techniques an equipment for farming.

The most important improvement that I would like to make is -electricity. I will educate
the people about the benefits of solar energy. | would encourage them to make most of this
natural source of energy.

All these facilities would make my village an ideal place to live in. People would have a
better life. | would like to name my campaign “Maru Gaam, Aadarsh Gaam”.

They employed more than 20,000 workers from India ,Persia, Europe and the Ottoman empire
-about 1,000elephant worked for around two decades to complete this huge structure.

There are beautiful gardens with fountains. it adds to the beauty of this magnificent
structure. it is said that not only Mumtaz Mahal, but Shah Jahan and Gauharara Begum are also
buried here.

Indeed the Taj Mahal is a splendid creation of man.

[5] The Problems of Homemakers.

work -rising early before everyone else and going to bed late after everyone else-no

holidays-problems at home-dedication and tireless work - usually not appreciated -

not respected as working women are - selfless love for family members-desire for a

vacation from household work)

"The man in our society is the breadwinner;
the woman has enough to do as the homemaker, wife and mother."
- Dorothy Fields

A lot is written or said about the probles of working women. But, no one cares about the
probles of homemakes or housewives in our society. They are doing really thankless jobs in
our homes. A housewife or a mother is the most important member ouf our family.

A homemaker plays the most important role in a family. She works tirelessly to fulfil the
expectations of each and every member of the family. Her work is endless . She gets up early
in the morning before everyone else. She takes care of the needs of her husband and children.
She sees to it that they are never late to office or school.

A homemaker works tirelessly from morning to late night. Even on holidays ! even if
she is not well, she will still do all her duties lovingly. A homemaker dedicates her life to her
home and family. But often her work is never appreciated by her family. Sometimes, her
dedication and sacrifice are taken for granted by everyone. Her only motivation is her love for
her family.

I wish we understand and appreciate a homemaker. Each of us should help her in her
work. She should have holidays, too she should be able to enjoy free time, just like we all do.

It is said in the report of the 'Kothari commission’ related to education system that the

destiny of India is being shaped in classrooms. It is absolutely correct and for that, the roels of
ideal teachers become much more important. One such teacher is Mr Bhatt for me.

He taught us English in high school. We have never felt boredom in his class. He was
used to teach the difficult grammatical points, units and poems by making them so interesting
with practical examples. He was also a good singer writer and actor too. While teaching we
had seen them in different roles but he remained totally focused on their objectives. Every
year while teaching grammar, he used different easy innovative techniques. His ways of giving
us inspiration to make our English better are still fresh in my mind.

Though he was a keen expert and well-disciplined teacher, he was full of care and
sympathy. He was always ready to help his students not only for learning but supporting them
economically too without saying a word -he was as rock but as mild as flower too. He always
guided to make our English more better.

He always told us that if we would forget him that wouldn’t displease him but learning
English should never be forgotten by us. He not only taught us but gave us vision of life by his
acts.To be honest i can never forget Mr.Bhatt because he had always worried to make their
pupils better than him. Once he had rightly said that be wanted to make us greater himself
keeping in mind the Upanishad mantra. I convey my regards to this special teacher heartily.

[7] ‘Nalanda University of ancient India’

The Nalanda university was one of the ancient Indian university. It was also the most
famous university .it was located in Biha. About 88kilometres from Patna. it had a great
influence of Buddhism.

The Nalanda university was established during the Gupta dynasty. It was the best
university in the world. The famous Chiness scholar xuanzang (hiuen-tsang) visited this
university and stayed there for a long time. He had written much about it in his texts.

The Nalanda university had about 10,000students and 2000 teachers. Student from all
over the world, including Korea, Japan, china, Tibet, Indonesia and Persia came to this
university to study. The admission process here was very strict. Students had to undergo
different tests to prove their ability.

The Nalanda university was spread in an area of about 14hectares.besides the
classrooms, it had a huge library, which contained religious, manuscripts and also a large
collection of books on literature, astrology ,astronomy and medicine. The university had 10
temples and medicine. The main building was called Ratnasagara. It was a nine - storeyed
building. In the ancient time ,Bakhtiyar Khilji had destroyed this mangnificent university.

Birds are very useful to us. Some birds eat the insects that are harmful to the crops.
Some birds also help in spreading clean by eating the carcasses. The peacock is called the

harbinger of rains .all of us are fascinated when the peacock spreads its feathers and dances.
But today, most of the birds have become endangered species. why is it so? Well, we are
majorly responsible for creating this imbalance in the eco-system . For example, we rarely see
the house sparrow now. What happened to them? Well, we human beings have destroyed
their homes. We have designed our houses in such a way that sparrows cannot enter into
them. They do not find safe places to build their nests.

We have started cutting tress for concrete building. The birds have lost their homes and
food. Another important reason for decline in the number of birds, especially sparrows, is the
radiation from the cell phone towers. Excessive use of wireless devises is also a danger to the
birds. We use unleaded petrol, chemical fertilizers and insecticides. This is harmful to the
birds. There is a lot of noise pollution, air pollution and water pollution .as a result, we see less
and less number of birds in cities.

Are there any remedies to save the birds? yes, there are. let us all bring the birds back
into our lives. We should keep bird-boxes and bird feeders outside our houses and in the
gardens. We should feed them. If there is enough space, we can keep big bowls of cool water
for them to bathe in. We should plant tress to encourage some of the common birds to came
back.

(types of birds-your favourite bird -name-habitat -special features-food -shape-size-

it)
“Birds are indicators of the environment.
If they are in trouble, we know we'll soon be in trouble."
- Roger Peterson

There are so many types of birds around us. But my favourite bird is the peacock. The
peacock is our national bird. It is a very beautiful bird. It has long and slender neck. It has a
crest on its head. It has long, beautiful and colourful feathers.

The peacock has a very charming walk. It is called the harbinger of rains. We can hear
its sweet call during the rainy season. It spreads out its colourful feathers like a fan and dances
in the rain. It is a great pleasure to see it dancing.

The peacock lives on tress. It is usually found in fields and forests. It feeds on grains,
insects and worms. It also catches snakes and eats them up. Therefore, the peacock is called
an enemy of snakes. The peacock can not fly very high. It has a slow but graceful walk. It struts
about majestically. The female peacock is called a peahen. The peahen does not have colourful
feathers. It does not look beautiful. It is a plain bird.

The feathers of the peacock are used to make many decorative items. Children love

harvest where you haven’t planted.”
- David Bly

I will be appearing for my10th standard board examination this March. I have already
prepared myself well for the tough schedule. I have a fixed daily routine. | have prepared a
timetable for revision of each subject. I make sure I follow that timetable so that I am free from
any stress or tension. Since I can study and remember well early in the morning, | get up at 5
am and revise all the difficult subjects. This improves my retention. I have adopted several
styles of learning subjects. In Maths and Science, | usually remember by writing and drawing
diagrams and flowcharts, Languages can be best revised through concentrated reading. I also
take help and advice of my parents and teachers about how best I can prepare myself for the
board exam. I have changed my food habits also. I take light food, which is easy to digest. I eat
plenty of salads and fruits. After my morning revision, I go for walk or
exercise. I also spend time talking to my parents and friends. It refreshes me. In the evening I
play for some and also watch tv for an hour. I am confident of getting good marks.
